# MUZE-Networking-Project


This platform starts with a very simple design that only provides basic features of uploading and downloading songs to a given server. You then embark on improving this platform gradually starting from supporting multiple users simultaneously,
to upgrading to a more scalable and efficient architecture, and finally enabling actual streaming functionality. I used TCP as the underlying transport layer. protocol. To be eligible to use
this service, users have to upload one song once they create their account to help populate the
repository of songs at the server side. The server keeps a record of all songs in its repository
and specifies the users who contributed each song
